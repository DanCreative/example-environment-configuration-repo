# Managing Gateway Deployments the GitOps way

This repository uses Weaveworks' Flux: https://github.com/weaveworks/flux. This example repository includes 2 gateway environments which is specified as _dev_ and _test_.

## Introduction

Recall that having your own dedicated environment configuration repository in GitHub allows you to separate environment configuration from static Gateway policies and services. In order to connect your configuration repository to the CI pipeline, you'll also need to install Weave Flux.
